SmartCloset
===========

Right now we have the basic Google App Engine example program. To work on it, download the SDK here:
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/devenvironment
and obviously clone this repo. Using the App Engine Launcher you can launch the app on your own machine and test it. So I'd encourage you to do that instead of deploying to the website every time. 

If you're a collaborator on the Google App Engine project you should be able to deploy it to http://smart-closet.appspot.com





A) a closet simulator, it should keep a list of your clothes, info about whether your clothes are dirty, your warmth weights of your clothes ( how warm you think they are, just an int or double), some preferences like how many times you rewear your clothes before washing, some method of manual adjustments

B) a script or program that can pull from at least 2 of the weather data sources from our doc last week and parses that data for useful information.

C) some method of reading from both to make clothing suggestions based on some basic preferences.

D) a ui for the closet and a UK for the suggestion maker.
